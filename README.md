# EfficienSEE

EfficienSEE is a powerful work management tool I've developed to streamline task assignment, tracking, and collaboration across different user roles. It's designed to boost productivity and maintain clear communication within teams.

## Key Features

- **Multi-level User Interfaces**: Customized dashboards for owners, admins, employees, and users
- **Task Management**: Admins can assign and track tasks, while employees can view, filter, and update their assigned tasks
- **Project Creation**: Owners can initiate new projects and invite team members
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant updates on task status changes and project invitations
- **Access Control**: Owners have full access and can manage user roles, including removing admins or employees if necessary

## How It Works

1. **Owner Dashboard**: 
   - Full application access

   - Monitor overall progress

2. **Admin Interface**:
   - Assign tasks to employees
   - Track assigned tasks
   - Receive notifications on task updates

3. **Employee Portal**:

4. **User Management**:
